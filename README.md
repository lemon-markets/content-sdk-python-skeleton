## 👋 Introduction 

This is a public [lemon.markets](https://lemon.markets) repository that demonstrates the general structure of a lemon.markets project and how you can use our Python SDK! 
To get a general understanding of the API, please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.lemon.markets).

A walk-through of this script can be found in our YouTube video.

Not interested in reading a novella before you get started? We get it! To get this project up and running quickly, here's what you need to do:
1. Clone this repository;
2. Sign up to [lemon.markets](https://www.lemon.markets/)
3. Configure your environment variables as outlined in the 'Configuration' section;
4. Take a look at the demo functions in main.py, and, if you want to, check out our accompanying YouTube video!
5. Run the script & see how it performs! 


## 🔌 API Usage

This project uses the [lemon.markets API](https://www.lemon.markets/en-de/for-developers) and the lemon.markets Python SDK.

lemon.markets is a brokerage API by developers for developers that allows you to build your own experience at the stock market. 
We will use the Market Data API and Trading API to show you the results you receive when you make calls to the venues, account, and trades endpoints.
If you do not have a lemon.markets account yet, you can sign up at [lemon.markets](https://www.lemon.markets/).

## ⚙️ Configuration

The script uses several environment variables, configure your .env file as follows:

| ENV Variable    |               Explanation               |
|-----------------|:---------------------------------------:|
| DATA_API_KEY    |        Your market data API key         |
| TRADING_API_KEY |    Your paper/money trading API key     |
| MIC             | Market Identifier Code of Trading Venue |


This (and all lemon.markets open source projects) is(are) a work in progress. If you are interested in contributing to this repository, simply create a PR and/or contact us at [support@lemon.markets](mailto:support@lemon.markets).
